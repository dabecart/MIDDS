# MIDDS Visualizer
*A real time dashboard for MIDDS, by @dabecart.*

## How to run it

MIDDS Visualizer has been developed and tested on Python 3.10.8.

To run, create a virtual environment, install the [requirements](requirements.txt) file and run [Main.py](Main.py). This will create a *localhost* server to connect to with your preferred browser. 

*Small tip:* If running on Ubuntu 20.04, the packages in [the ubuntu_pkgs folder](docs\ubuntu_pkgs) must be installed.
